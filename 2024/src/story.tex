As a child, computers fascinated me. I made a promise to myself to uncover its secrets.
So I studied hard and became top 1\% who entered the university. I had to work full-time while studying. Over time, I advanced in my career, and now I hold the position of Senior Software Engineer. I have strong understanding of software development principles \& do open-source contribution occasionally. Helping and managing people is my passion.
